# Presentation

This is my personal [Neovim](neovim.io). It is not made to be copy pasted, nor to be used on another machines than mine, but simply serve as an example for people looking to create similar configs
It currently works on Neovim version `Stable 0.9.1`, and would probably work on any installation (Above version `0.8.0` I would suppose)

Note: This config uses files that are present on my system. Those plugins, in their stable versions, are also available on my github
    
## Main config content

- Lsp setup
- Telescope and window navigation
- Efficient and fast loading times

## Important notes

My notion integration is homemade, and available at [Al0den/notion.nvim](https://github.com/Al0den/notion.nvim), same for my testing plugin, [Al0den/tester.nvim](https://github.com/Al0den/tester.nvim).
Downloading them and using them might or might not work, replacing the appropriate lines in `lua/plugins.lua` with the ones provided on these pages should fix them!
